The code you provided is a Python function that calculates the maximum profit that can be obtained from a list of stock prices. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:`: This line defines a function called `maxProfit` that takes two parameters: `self` (which implies it is within a class) and `prices`, which is expected to be a list of integers. The return type of the function is specified as an integer.

2. `buy = 0`: This line initializes the `buy` variable with a value of 0. The `buy` variable keeps track of the index of the day when you would buy the stock.

3. `sell = 1`: This line initializes the `sell` variable with a value of 1. The `sell` variable keeps track of the index of the day when you would sell the stock.

4. `max_profit = 0`: This line initializes the `max_profit` variable with a value of 0. This variable will store the maximum profit obtained.

5. `while sell < len(prices):`: This line starts a while loop that continues until the `sell` variable is less than the length of the `prices` list. This loop iterates over the list of prices to calculate the maximum profit.

6. `current_profit = prices[sell] - prices[buy]`: This line calculates the current profit by subtracting the buying price (`prices[buy]`) from the selling price (`prices[sell]`).

7. `if prices[buy] < prices[sell]:`: This line checks if the buying price is less than the selling price. If this condition is true, it means a profit can be made.

8. `max_profit = max(max_profit, current_profit)`: This line compares the `max_profit` variable with the `current_profit` variable and updates `max_profit` with the larger value. It ensures that `max_profit` always holds the maximum profit seen so far.

9. `else:`: This line is executed when the buying price is not less than the selling price. It means that the current selling price is not profitable, so the `buy` variable is updated to the current `sell` index.

10. `sell += 1`: This line increments the `sell` variable by 1, moving to the next day in the list to check for potential profits.

11. `return max_profit`: This line returns the maximum profit obtained after iterating over the list of prices.

In summary, the function iterates through the list of prices, comparing each selling price to the buying price and updating the maximum profit if a higher profit is found. The function returns the maximum profit that can be obtained from the given list of stock prices.
